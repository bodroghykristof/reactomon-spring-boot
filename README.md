# reactomon-spring-boot

## Introduction

This project is a non-compulsory side-project for Codecool project Reactomon.
The latter is a one-pager application developed in React. Originially it fetches data from 3rd-party
APIs. This project provides a back-end for it.

## What I am attempting to learn

- using React with self-implemented back-end
- practicing Spring Boot
- CORS
